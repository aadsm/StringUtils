StringUtils
===========

This library was meant to be used with Jacob Seidelin's BinaryAjax library. 
The necessity for reading UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings was risen while developing the ID3 reader [ID3 Reader](http://www.aadsm.net/libraries/id3/) since the input is only an array of bytes that must be read in a specific charset.

`StringUtils.readUTF8String(bytes, [maxBytes])`  
    `bytes` - The array of bytes to be read.  
    `maxBytes` - Optional parameter, maximum number of bytes to be read from the array. Default value is: `bytes.length`.  
    `return value` - A String object with an aditional `bytesReadCount` property indicating how many bytes were read to create the string.

`StringUtils.readUTF16String(bytes, [bigEndian], [maxBytes])`  
    `bytes` - The array of bytes to be read.  
    `bigEndian` - Optional parameter, the endianness of the string to be read. This parameter is only used when the string doesn't have a BOM. Default value is: `false`  
    `maxBytes` - Optional parameter, maximum number of bytes to be read from the array. Default value is: `bytes.length`.  
    `return value` - A String object with an aditional `bytesReadCount` property indicating how many bytes were read to create the string.
